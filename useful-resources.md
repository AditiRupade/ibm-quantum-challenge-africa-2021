# Useful Learning Resources

Whether you are new to quantum computing or an experienced physicist/scientist/engineer,
you should find the following resources useful to expand your knowledge of the field.
Some of these resources were collated during the Live Q&A session before the
IBM Quantum Challenge Africa 2021, though others were added afterwards.

## Qiskit Textbook

[https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html)

This open-source and community driven textbook covers nearly everything to do with
quantum computing and Qiskit. As a member of the quantum computing community, you can
submit corrections or changes to the textbook to further improve its content for
future learners.

### Beta Qiskit Textbook

There is a new beta version of the Qiskit Textbook, with more sophisticated
visualization and a different structure. Though it contains similar content to
the current textbook, it is still under construction.

## Qiskit Documentation

[https://qiskit.org/documentation/](https://qiskit.org/documentation/)

The Qiskit Library Documentation is very useful if you are familiar with Python
and how software libraries are typically organized. The documentation covers
best-practices, current interfaces for Qiskit functionality, and tutorials on
specific topics. This is your go-to place for technical details on Qiskit and its
implementation.

## Qiskit Slack

The Qiskit Slack workspace brings researchers, lecturers, and students together in
a single collaborative space. You can ask questions, receive announcements about
new features, and discuss quantum computing and Qiskit topics with other experts.
To join the Qiskit Slack workspace, you can follow the link below.

## Quantum Algorithm Zoo

[https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/](https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/)

Whether you are looking for a quantum computing algorithm for a specific
application, or investigating which computational problems are applicable for
quantum computing, the Quantum Algorithm Zoo is a required stop in your journey
through quantum computing. The website collates current algorithms and their
known speed-ups and limitations. Though it is not as accessible as other resources,
the Quantum Algorithm Zoo is an important tool once you have developed your
quantum computing skills.
